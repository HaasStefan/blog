    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-3 mb-2">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The key idea behind microfrontends is to lazy load code at runtime, such
      that the Angular compiler does not need to know about the lazy loaded
      feature modules at runtime. This is especially useful, when multiple teams
      are working on a project and independent deployment is necessary for
      productivity.
      <br /><br />
      Although this is the key idea, this wonâ€™t work like that out-of-the-box,
      because Angular is not able to resolve the dependency at compile time.
      Webpack can be used to do some magic things under the hood, such that lazy
      loading works with the help of a module federation plugin.
