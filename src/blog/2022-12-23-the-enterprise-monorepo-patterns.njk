subtitle: Leverage the full potential of Nx with Eslint rules and the Enterprise Monorepo Patterns

description: Nx is a commonly used tool for monorepositories and is the top dog in the Angular community when it comes to building enterprise applications. Nx has many awesome features that help with scaling enterprise applications, but the greatest feature of them all is the nx/enforce-module-boundaries linting rule (also often referred to as access restrictions). When set up correctly, it allows for enforcing architecture rules and for automated validation with the linter. But these access restrictions assume a very specific structuring which follows fine-grained horizontal and vertical slicing.

    Horizontal Slicing is obviously very important in every enterprise application independent of the enterprise monorepo patterns.
    It is just about slicing a big monolith into subsystems, often referred to domains or subdomains, especially if you follow principles of Domain Driven Design, such as Strategic Design, which gives some very useful tools to find a good horizontal slicing.
    In the case of an insurance CRM, which manages claims, contracts, customers, complaints and notifications, we would split this system into said subdomains.
