        question: 'Why should I learn about Nx?',
        answer: 'It provides a set of tools that help you to build, test, and deploy your applications. It allows for a modular architecture and makes it possible to enforce architectural constraints. Build times are faster and the developer experience is better. Workflows can be automated and the code quality can be improved.'
   } ,
   {
    question: 'What are the prerequisites for this workshop?',
    answer: 'You should already have some experience with Angular and the Angular CLI. You should be able to build applications using components, services, directives, RxJS, and routing. But you do not need to be an expert.'
},
{
    question: 'At which times does the workshop take place?',
    answer: 'The workshop starts at 9:00 and ends at 16:30. There is a lunch break from 12:00 to 13:00 and two coffee breaks from 10:30 to 11:00 and 15:30 to 16:00.'
},
{
    question: 'What do I need to bring?',
    answer: 'You need to bring your own laptop with the LTS version of Node.js installed and a global installation of the Angular CLI and Nx. You also need a code editor of your choice (e.g. VS Code).'
},
{
    question: 'What is the maximum number of participants?',
    answer: 'The maximum number of participants is 15. This ensures that I can take care of every participant.'
},
{
    question: 'Where does the workshop take place?',
    answer: 'Either remote anywhere in the world or at your company. You would need to provide a room with a projector and a whiteboard.'
